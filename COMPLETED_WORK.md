## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture

**Clean Architecture Pattern**:
```
Presentation Layer (API Routes)
    ↓
Business Logic Layer (Services)
    ↓
Data Access Layer (Models & Database)
```

**Components**:
1. **API Routes** (`api/routes/`) - HTTP endpoint handlers
2. **Services** (`services/`) - Business logic
3. **Models** (`models.py`) - Database schemas
4. **Schemas** (`schemas.py`) - Data validation
5. **Middleware** (`api/middleware/`) - Cross-cutting concerns
6. **Utils** (`utils/`) - Helper functions
7. **Config** (`config/`) - Settings management

### Security Implementation

```
✓ Password hashing (bcrypt with salt)
✓ JWT token authentication
✓ Role-based access control (RBAC)
✓ Permission-based authorization
✓ SQL injection prevention (ORM)
✓ CORS protection
✓ Input validation (Pydantic)
✓ XSS protection
✓ Audit trails (created_at, updated_at, marked_by)
✓ Soft delete capability
```

### Database Design

**Normalized Schema**:
- Users table (1:1 with Student/Faculty)
- Role-specific tables (Student, Faculty)
- Relationship tables (Attendance, Timetable)
- Reference tables (Subject, Notification)

**Features**:
- Foreign key constraints
- Cascade deletes
- Unique constraints
- Indexes on frequently queried columns
- TIMESTAMP tracking
- Boolean flags for soft delete

### API Design

**RESTful Principles**:
- Resource-based URLs
- HTTP method semantics (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 422)
- JSON request/response
- Pagination support
- Filtering and search

**Organization**:
- `/api/auth/*` - Authentication
- `/api/students/*` - Student operations
- `/api/faculty/*` - Faculty operations
- `/api/subjects/*` - Subject management
