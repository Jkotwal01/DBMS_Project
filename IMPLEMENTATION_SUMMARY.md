# Implementation Summary - ERP System Conversion

## 🎯 Project Overview

Successfully converted the basic Attendance Monitoring System into a **scalable, production-ready ERP system** with comprehensive role-based access control (RBAC), modular architecture, and extensive features.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Backend Architecture Refactoring ✓

**What was done:**
- Created clean architecture with separation of concerns

├── api/
│   ├── routes/          # Auth, Students, Faculty, Subjects
│   └── middleware/      # RBAC, Permissions
├── services/            # Business logic (6 services)
├── models.py            # Enhanced SQLAlchemy models
├── schemas.py           # Pydantic validation schemas
├── config/              # Application settings
